300.01
======

An experiential game about mental health.  While the game itself is not ready
for play, it will be available [here](http://300.01.drab-makyo.com).

This README is necessarily sparse.  The game is written in literate
CoffeeScript, and thus most of the information is available there.  However, all
of that is available in the game itself through an overlay.
